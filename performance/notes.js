// Client side rendering vs Server side rendering

// Client Side Rendering        
// Pros                             Cons
// Rich Interaction                 Slower Initial Load
// Reduced Server Interactions      Bad For Search Engine Optimization
// Better Client Side Caching       Dependecy on the user device


// Server Side Rendering
// Pros                     Cons
// Faster Initial Load      Increase Load on Server
// Better SEO               Frequent Server Request can increase latency
// Consistent Performance   More Complex to implement




// Core Web Vitals
// LCP : Largest Contentful Paint : Largest Section visible to user when user loads the route
// How to improve it : by converting the images from the png to webp
// LCP is measured on the mobile first therefore we need to improve it over there first then 
// we can improve it elsewhere

// CLS : Cumulative layout shift
// CLS is measure of largest burst of layout shift score for every unexpected layout shift that occurs
// during the lifespan of page


// INP : Interaction to next paint
// If there is a blocking task and that blocking task is creating too much rampage such that
// next paint is taking time then our score will be bad



// Accessiblity
// Web accessiblity means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so 
// that people with disabilities can use them
